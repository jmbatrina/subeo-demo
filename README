LRT cashier side is at lrt/index.html
Passenger side is at passenger/index.html

For Android, need ng http server (e.g. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phlox.simpleserver) since opening an html is sandboxed on its own context without access to js scripts.

#General Flow
- LRT generates question Form QR
- Passenger scans QR
- Passenger fills out generated form
- Passenger generates Answer QR
- LRT scans Answer QR to get passenger details
